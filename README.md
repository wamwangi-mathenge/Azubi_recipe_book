# Azubi Recipe Book

## INTRODUCTION
Welcome to our collaborative recipe book project! In this project, you will work in a team of 5 to create a recipe book containing each member's favorite recipe.

To manage the version control of the recipe book, we will be using Git and GitHub. Each team member will be responsible for creating their own branch and adding their recipe to the book. This will allow us to collaborate efficiently while keeping track of all changes made to the project.

## GOAL
Throughout the project, you will learn how to use Git and GitHub to create, commit, and push changes to your own branches. You will also learn how to merge changes from other branches and resolve conflicts that may arise during the process.

## EVALUATIONS
Once the recipe book is completed, teams will share the final version on GitHub for others to view and enjoy. This will not only showcase your collaboration and technical skills but also your creativity and passion for good food.

So, get ready to work as a team, learn new skills, and create a mouthwatering recipe book that everyone will love!
